## ❔  Who are we  ❔
JCubeWare is currently a setting up organization that provides open-source 
projects that simplify and modernize the C programming language experience.

Our ultimate goal is to create an OS and contribute to a new era of fast and 
reliable products that are easy to develop, build, maintain and extend.

Say goodbye to infinite dependencies, thousands of mega bytes of extra libraries
and RAM usage jumping through the roof!
